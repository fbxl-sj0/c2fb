    Project: SQLite FreeBASIC port tools

    File: c2fb_c_records.bi

    Purpose:

        Bind C record member types to existing FreeBASIC layouts for body
        conversion.

    Responsibilities:

        - Read C record declarations from the shared declaration table.
        - Index source and FreeBASIC field names for bounded member lookup.
        - Retain scalar, pointer, array, and nested record member types.
        - Preserve supported C bitfield widths from their original expressions.
        - Give anonymous C records a stable path through their containing field.
        - Match existing BASIC record names through corresponding fields.
        - Generate private BASIC layouts for safe, complete source-local structs.
        - Prefer an exact C record tag before resolving typedef aliases.
        - Supply C member types when the port stores a pointer as Any Ptr.

    This file intentionally does NOT contain:

        - Guessing layouts for unions, packed records, bitfields, or incomplete types.
        - Claims that partial port layouts match C.
        - Preprocessor branch evaluation or C record memory offsets.
