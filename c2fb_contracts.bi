    Project: SQLite FreeBASIC port tools

    File: c2fb_contracts.bi

    Purpose:

        Declare the internal services shared across C2FB pipeline modules.

    Responsibilities:

        - Describe cross-module declaration, type, symbol, and body services.
        - Keep include-order dependencies out of the command-line driver.
        - Define the narrow C runtime call used by the process adapter.

    This file intentionally does NOT contain:

        - Service implementations or translation policy.
        - Command parsing, dispatch, or output formatting.
