    Project: C2FB declaration helpers
    ----------------------------------

    File: c2fb_declaration_helpers.bi

    Purpose:

        Normalize compiler attributes in C declarations before shared
        declarator and prototype parsing.

    Responsibilities:

        - Remove attribute groups from declaration text.
        - Preserve calling-convention attributes as canonical tokens.
        - Remove the GNU __extension__ diagnostic marker without changing the declaration.

    This file intentionally does NOT contain:

        - C declarator parsing or prototype lowering.
        - Target ABI mapping or generated output formatting.
