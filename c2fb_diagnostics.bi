    Project: C2FB diagnostics
    ------------------------

    File: c2fb_diagnostics.bi

    Purpose:

        Collect source-located diagnostics and send conversion rejections
        through the shared diagnostic output model.

    Responsibilities:

        - Format fatal command failures as diagnostic records and exit with status 1.
        - Bound and reset diagnostics for one translation invocation.
        - Create stable diagnostic codes from pass-owned reasons.
        - Record skipped declarations, body rejections, and preprocessing failures.
        - Route diagnostics to generated output or the shared console formatter.
        - Abort active generated files before a fatal command exit.

    This file intentionally does NOT contain:

        - C syntax classification or target-specific rejection policy.
        - FreeBASIC diagnostic formatting, option parsing, or command dispatch.
