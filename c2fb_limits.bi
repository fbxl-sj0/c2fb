    Project: SQLite FreeBASIC port tools

    File: c2fb_limits.bi

    Purpose:

        Define the bounded resource limits shared by the C2FB pipeline.

    Responsibilities:

        - Bound token, declaration, source-file, and symbol collections.
        - Bound body-local storage and generated array dimensions.
        - Bound compiler argument expansion and response-file nesting.

    This file intentionally does NOT contain:

        - Translation models or command dispatch identifiers.
        - Input parsing, allocation, or limit-reporting behavior.
