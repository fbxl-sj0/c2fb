    Project: SQLite FreeBASIC port tools

    File: c2fb_model.bi

    Purpose:

        Define the shared translation models and own per-input and project
        state used by C2FB.

    Responsibilities:

        - Record declarator names, token spans, and binding operators.
        - Record target-independent C types and resolved FreeBASIC type shapes.
        - Preserve type-resolution status with the mapped type and qualifiers.
        - Select whether unknown type names may use target fallback mappings.
        - Distinguish omitted, variadic, converted, and unsupported parameters.
        - Distinguish non-array typedefs from converted and unsupported arrays.
        - Distinguish non-callback types from converted and unsupported callbacks.
        - Retain scanned declaration syntax and source-origin facts.
        - Keep declaration start and end origins together as source spans.
        - Track when preprocessing preserves a path but removes C coordinates.
        - Give header, typedef, and callback conversion one parse result.
        - Retain source paths and line spans on scanned declarations.
        - Carry shared body-lowering settings across file and tree adapters.
        - Represent normalized simple-body, generic-body, and preprocessed-tree
          input requests.
        - Describe compiler input and output paths for C preprocessing.
        - Return structured compiler and output-file status for preprocessing.
        - Carry active source path, line, and column in one location model.
        - Represent shared C macro directive syntax, replacement text, and
          optional replacement tokens.
        - Carry source paths and explicit collection policy into the shared C
          declaration scanner.
        - Keep generic-header macro lowering and SQLite define state in
          separate models built from shared macro definitions.
        - Group body-only and generic-C translation state by owner.
        - Store replacement rules shared by generic-header macros and bodies.
        - Retain expanded command arguments in a bounded list model.
        - Route mode-specific request models through one command model.
        - Type the SQLite extension API table generator's request and result.
        - Type command and shared-symbol discriminants with named enums.
        - Retain selected C source files as a bounded file-set model.
        - Own source-specific symbols, aliases, overrides, records, and macros.
        - Keep generic source filters and their audit state in policy.
        - Keep generic declaration guard patterns and their audit state in policy.
        - Store ordered generic-header declaration moves and their outcomes.
        - Track requested typedef expansion names and their matches.
        - Track selected macro expansion patterns and their outcomes.
        - Track opt-in integer-macro assumptions and their matches.
        - Track selected generic forward declaration patterns and their matches.
        - Store generic-header inline body emission policy.
        - Keep generic-header and body facts separate within shared C symbols.
        - Retain typed external C objects used by generic body candidates.
        - Store generic-header record decisions separately from scanned syntax.
        - Represent diagnostics and lowered artifacts shared by passes and
          output backends.
        - Carry conversion totals across nested lowering passes.
        - Keep reusable FreeBASIC source indexes separate from C input state.

    This file intentionally does NOT contain:

        - Target type mappings or FreeBASIC output formatting.
        - Input scanning, preprocessing, or function-body translation.
